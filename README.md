## Version 2.0

### What's new?
* The app now saves data to localStorage.
* The app's timekeeping logic is not fully-functional.
* HTML/cosmetic fixes.

## Notes:

* This application uses jQuery to provide a color-coded and intuitive inteface for planning your day.
* Simply click within the text area of each time block, fill out your task, and click "save."
* Using localStorage functionality, the app retains the user's data when the page is refreshed.
